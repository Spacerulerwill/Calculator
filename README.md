# Calculator
A simple command line calculator I'm working on

## Features
* Real and complex number arithmetic
* Vector operations
* Scientific notation for numbers
* Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `!`, `√`
* Groupings: `()`, `|absolute|`, `⌈ceil⌉`,  `⌊floor⌋`
* Pre-defined functions and constants
* User defined variables and functions
* Pre-load constants, functions and pre-run expressions from a file
* `delete` operator for managing functions and variables
* `clear` operator to reset all user defined variables and functions
* Expression history and recall

## Todo
* Matrix operations
* Different number bases (1-16, 32 and 64)
* Support for different units and dimensions (e.g. `3m + 5ft`)
* Graph plots
